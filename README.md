# Spot Anomaly Inspection
This code base deploys the Boston Dynamics Spot robot to inspect sound anomalies. When a sound anomly is detected from an external sensor, a deploy request is sent to a server hosted on the Spot core. Spot then autonomously navigates to the external sensor and records images and audio. When Spot is done collecting data, it returns to the dock.

# Demo
Note: watch the video with sound to hear the anomaly which triggers the autonomous inspection
